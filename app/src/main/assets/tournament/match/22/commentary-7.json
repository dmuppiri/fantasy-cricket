However, on Friday they turned up at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad in style, restricting table-toppers Rajasthan Royals to a modest 130, after which their batsmen chased down the runs in 16.1 overs. The nine-wicket win was RCB s second victory in the tournament   which came at the back of three consecutive defeats, while RR suffered a defeat for the second time in seven outings. RCB s victory   by nine wickets and with 23 balls to spare   was the most convincing run-chase of the season. \\n \\n RCB captain Virat Kolhi won the toss for the fourth time in the season, gave his bowlers the first use of the pitch and they responded brilliantly setting up the match. Ajinkya Rahane and Shane Watson, as they have done so often this season, got the hosts off to a solid start, adding 36 runs before the former was dismissed off the last ball of the fifth over. Rahane made 18, aided with two boundaries and a six, when he was trapped lbw by an off-cutter from Harshal Patel. \\n \\n Watson welcomed leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal   who was introduced into the attack in the sixth over - with a six and put him away for a boundary two balls later, but perished off the following delivery when he pulled a long hop straight to the man at midwicket. The RR captain made 26 from 22 balls, aided with four boundaries and a six. \\n \\n Having seen the back of RR s two in-form batsmen, RCB never eased the pressure thereafter. The bowlers hit the right areas consistently and forced the batsmen to take risks. That formula worked well for RCB as they kept picking up wickets at regular intervals. Karun Nair was run out attempting a difficult second run, while the two youngsters   Deepak Hooda and Sanju Samson - had their woodwork rearranged by Iqbal Abdulla and Chahal respectively they attempted to play across the line strokes. \\n \\n Steve Smith would be RR s top-scorer; he made 31 from 28 balls and hit two boundaries before being sixth man out in the eighteenth over. RR finished their allotted twenty overs at 130 for 9   their lowest total of the season. There was only one over in the innings in which the RR batsmen could score 10 or more, and the 36-run opening stand was the highest of the innings. There were only ten boundaries and three sixes in the RR innings to go with 44 dot balls. \\n \\n For RCB, the bowlers were sensational. Mitchell Starc, with figures of 3 for 22, would finish the most successful bowler of the match, and he was ably supported by young Harshal Patel (2-23) and Chahal. Iqbal Abdulla played an important role in plugging the flow or runs, bowling ten dot balls in his four overs, while finishing with figures of one for 28. \\n \\n RCB had a mixed day on the field, but there was one act on the field that stood out   the catch taken by Dinesh Karthik to dismiss James Faulkner. The Australian walked towards the off-side and attempted to scoop the ball fine on the leg-side. But Karthik was alert to a possible chance, moved swiftly to his left, dived full length and came up with the ball with his outstretched arm. \\n \\n Cut to chase, RCB were given a flying start by Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli. The Jamaican, who missed the previous match, scored 20 from 16 balls, and was involved in a 36-run opening partnership, before he was foxed by a slower delivery from Shane Watson and top-edged to the wicket-keeper. Kohli and AB de Villiers, who was promoted to bat at number three, completed the honours in clinical fashion with an unbeaten 98-run partnership; the RCB skipper was unbeaten on 62 from 46 balls, while de Villiers made 47 from 34 balls.","subtype":"BBCode","message":{"text":"<p><strong>Match Report:&nbsp;</strong>Royal Challengers Bangalore&rsquo;s bowlers didn&rsquo;t have the best of times in their first four matches of Pepsi IPL 2015.
