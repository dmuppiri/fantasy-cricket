After opting to field first, the SRH bowlers skittled out the hosts for 166   presenting the first occasion when a team was bowled out in Pepsi IPL 2015   and subsequently chased down the runs in the 18th over. \\n \\n After heading into the interval on a high, the Sunrisers Hyderabad openers came out all guns blazing and pushed the hosts onto the backfoot right from the word go. David Warner caressed the first ball of the run-chase   a low full toss from Sean Abbott   through covers to set the ball rolling. Dhawan wasn t one to miss out and picked up two boundaries too   one through cover and the second through midwicket. \\n \\n Thereafter Warner took off and the RCB bowlers found no answers to keep him quiet. Harshal Patel s first over cost 20, while Varun Aaron was hit for 15 runs in his second over as SRH raced to 50 in 4.2 overs. Boundaries and sixes came thick and fast; in the first seven overs, the ball had crossed over the ropes on 13 occasions. \\n \\n Yuzvendra Chahal was introduced into the attack in the eighth over, and though Warner hit him for a six, the bowler had the last laugh as he had the Australian batsman LBW. Warner, who got to his half-century off 24 balls   his fastest effort to the milestone, made 56 from 27 balls and hit six fours and four sixes during his stay at the crease. \\n \\n SRH got the start they wanted - with the opening pair posting 82 runs on the board   and it was fairly smooth sailing thereafter. Though Chahal had Kane Williamson stumped, there were no further hiccups as Dhawan, who was circumspect when Warner was going hammer and tongs, batted through and steered his team past the finish line. The left-handed Dhawan made 50 from 42 balls, and he had the company of KL Rahul (44) at the other end; the third wicket pair added 78 runs in 51 balls as SRH got passed the target with 16 balls to spare. \\n \\n Except for Yuzvendra Chahal   who finished with respectable figures of 2 for 28 from his four overs, the rest of the RCB bowlers had a second forgettable outing. \\n \\n Earlier in the evening, on a pitch that was freshened up by pre-match showers, the RCB openers Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli came out with positive intent and snatched the early initiative. Gayle set the ball rolling, launching himself and hitting Trent Boult for a six off the third ball he faced. The Jamaican hit three more boundaries and Kohli joined in the act, hitting two fours and a six, the former was dismissed in the sixth over. Praveen Kumar landed a half-volley on the pads, and Gayle whipped it off his legs, only to find Ashish Reddy at square-leg. Gayle made 21 from 16 balls and RCB were reduced to 43 for 1. \\n \\n Dinesh Karthik and Kohli added 34 runs, with the latter scoring the bulk of the runs in the partnership. Karthik was dismissed in the 11th over when he attempted a slog sweep, but the ball took the leading edge and landed in the safe hands of Kane Williamson. RCB slipped dramatically soon after as Kohli had his stumps rearranged and Mandeep Singh was pouched by a sensational catch by David Warner. \\n \\n AB de Villiers who finished innings top-scorer for RCB, was involved in two brief but useful partnerships; he added 32 runs in the company of Darren Sammy and a further 27 runs in the company of Sean Abbott. The South African favoured the leg-side generally; he attempted to hit Ravi Bopara over long-on, but was lucky in that the fielder on the fence   Shikhar Dhawan   took the catch but landed beyond the boundary after completing the catch. He then deposited Ashish Reddy into the stands at deep square-leg with the means of a slog-sweep. He was dismissed in the 19th over when he attempted to slash a Trent Boult wide delivery, but found Dhawan patrolling the sweeper cover boundary; he made 46 from 28 balls. Post de Villiers  dismissal, the RCB innings feel off the tracks as they lost four wickets in nine deliveries to become the first team to be bowled out for 166. \\n \\n For Sunrisers Hyderabad, leg-spinner Karn Sharma was the most economical bowler, finishing with returns of 1 for 20, while Trent Boult was the most successful picking up three wickets.","subtype":"BBCode","message":{"text":"<p><strong>Match Report:&nbsp;</strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad got their first points on the board when they defeated the Royal Challengers Bangalore by eight wickets at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.
