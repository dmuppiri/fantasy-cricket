Riding on a record 154-run partnership between Shreyas Iyer and JP Duminy, DD posted 190 runs on the board and then dismissed the visitors for 153-9. \\n \\n Earlier in the evening, the Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma called correctly at the toss and inserted the hosts in. Mitchell McClenaghan struck with the third delivery of the match when he dismissed Mayank Agarwal caught at short mid-wicket. But that was the joy the visitors would have for the next hour as Shreyas and skipper JP Duminy would stitch together a 154-run partnership   the highest in Pepsi IPL 2015   sending the Mumbai Indians bowlers on a leather hunt. Shreyas was the first to step up the pace; he hit the first boundary of the match when he worked a full length delivery from Lasith Malinga between mid on and midwicket. McClenaghan was subject to punishment in the following over when he was hit for a four and six. \\n \\n Duminy joined in, depositing Jasprit Bumrah into the stands off successive deliveries. When the field restrictions were relaxed, DD had raced to 45 for 1. There was a brief period of calm as the hosts added 20 runs in the next four overs. \\n \\n Bumrah was brought back into the attack in the eleventh over, and Shreyas got stuck into him, picking up a six and two fours off three successive deliveries. Duminy too got going at the other end, picking up a four and two sixes off Kieron Pollard. At the end of twelve overs, DD were placed at 101 for 1 and looked well-poised to post a total in excess of 200. \\n \\n Harbhajan Singh s first three overs had only cost MI 16, but his figures were destroyed in his final over when Shreyas picked up two sixes through the on-side; the MI off-spinner finished with figures of none for 34. The DD opening batsman was dismissed in the seventeenth when he walked across to the off-side with the intention of paddling a delivery to fine-leg, but lost his leg-stump to a searing Lasith Malinga yorker. \\n \\n The 20-year old, playing his first season of IPL, made 83   his career best score in T20 cricket   from 56 balls, seven of which found the boundary and five other sailed over the ropes. \\n \\n Though Angelo Mathews and Yuvraj Singh were dismissed in the last few overs, Duminy batted through to the end, finishing on 78 from 50 balls; the DD captain hit three boundaries and 6 sixes, as DD finished their twenty overs as 190 for 4. \\n \\n For MI, who fielded the same team that helped them defeat RCB, the Kiwi speedster McClenaghan was the most successful bowler returning with figures of 2 for 38. The young Bumrah was the most expensive bowler, conceding 55 runs in his four overs. \\n \\n MI started their run-chase in right earnest with Lendl Simmons and Parthiv Patel adding 35 runs in the first overs. Domnic Joseph separated the opening pair when Simmons miscued one and skipper Duminy took a well-judged catch at mid on. \\n \\n The visitors kept losing wickets at regular intervals and therefore didn t have any kind of momentum in their run-chase. MI s chased gathered steam briefly when Rohit Sharma and Ambati Rayudu added 49 in 5.4 overs. But when Nathan Coulter-Nile had the former caught at midwicket, the stuffing had been knocked from the chase. \\n \\n For the hosts, Imran Tahir picked up three wickets and ended the night reclaiming the Purple Cap, while Amit Mishra chipped in with two wickets.","subtype":"BBCode","message":{"text":"<p><strong>Match Report:&nbsp;</strong>The Delhi Daredevils broke their 9-match losing streak at the Ferozeshah Kotla in style as they defeated a formidable Mumbai Indians side by 37 runs.
