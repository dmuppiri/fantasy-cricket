Coming into the match at the back of a morale-boosting win over Kings XI Punjab that ended their 11-match losing streak, DD scored a commanding 167 runs on the board and then restricted the home side to 163-8. Skipper JP Duminy was the star performer for DD, first scoring a half-century and then derailing the SRH innings by picking up four wickets. \\n\\n After opting to bat first, the Delhi Daredevils lost opener Mayank Agarwal for 1, but were put back on track through a 78-run second-wicket partnership between Shreyas Iyer and skipper JP Duminy. 20-year old Iyer brought the attacking side of his game to the park, hitting three fours and five sixes, and in the process scoring his first half-century in T20 cricket. The Mumbai-lad comfortably outscored his skipper in the partnership, contributing 47 runs as against Duminy s 26 runs. He was particularly severe on the leg-spinner Karn Sharma, hitting him for three sixes and scoring 21 runs off eight deliveries. \\n\\n The opening batsman was dismissed in the twelfth over when he was deceived by a slower delivery from Praveen Kumar and miscued an attempted slog to be caught at cover; Iyer made 60 from 40 balls and left the park with the score reading 93 for 2. \\n\\n Duminy, who was initially scoring at a run-a-ball, switched gears after Iyer was dismissed; he hit Ravi Bopara for a boundary in the 13th over and then punished the medium-pacer further in his next over, hitting two fours and a six. In the 16th over, Duminy hit Dale Steyn for a six over long on, but the fast bowler had the last laugh, disturbing the woodwork behind the batsman. Duminy made 54 from 41 balls, aided with five boundaries and two sixes. \\n\\n DD suffered a big blow immediately after as Yuvraj Singh s innings was curtailed by a fantastic catch by David Warner; the left-hander s pull appeared to have enough height and distance, but Warner, fielding at midwicket, timed his jump well, caught the ball and landed just inside the rope. \\n\\n Angelo Mathews (19 from 12 balls) and Kedar Jadhav (15 from 11) found the boundary thrice in the last two overs to help DD finish their twenty overs at 167 for 4. \\n\\n For SRH, Steyn and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were the pick of the bowlers; their eight overs together cost the team 48 runs and yielded two wickets. Praveen Kumar and Ashish Reddy were the other wicket-takers. \\n\\n Cut to the run-chase, DD kept their nerves despite their opponents getting off to a solid start. Warner and Shikhar Dhawan helped their team to 20 in the first four overs before the latter exploded in the fifth over, hitting Angelo Mathews for three boundaries. Warner picked on Domnic Joseph and hit him for four boundaries in the following over. The partnership was broken just after the Powerplay overs when Duminy got the ball to straighten and sneak in between the bad and pad to castle Dhawan. Two balls later, Warner was beaten in flight and drove straight back, and Duminy lunged forward and came up with the ball in hand. From 50 for no loss, SRH had quickly slipped to 51 for two. \\n\\n KL Rahul struck two humongous sixes off Yuvraj Singh and Amit Mishra, and added 38 runs in the company of Ravi Bopara, before he lost his leg stump to Angelo Mathews. He made 24 from 21 balls and left the arena with his team needing 79 runs from 46 balls. \\n\\n Ravi Bopara hit a couple of lusty blows before he holed out to Manoj Tiwary. Karn Sharma took the chase closer, hitting two sixes off Imran Tahir, and Ashish Reddy hit a four and a six in the 19th over to leave SRH needing 10 from the final over.

Coming into the match at the back of a morale-boosting win over Kings XI Punjab that ended their 11-match losing streak, DD scored a commanding 167 runs on the board and then restricted the home side to 163-8. Skipper JP Duminy was the star performer for DD, first scoring a half-century and then derailing the SRH innings by picking up four wickets. <br /><br /> After opting to bat first, the Delhi Daredevils lost opener Mayank Agarwal for 1, but were put back on track through a 78-run second-wicket partnership between Shreyas Iyer and skipper JP Duminy. 20-year old Iyer brought the attacking side of his game to the park, hitting three fours and five sixes, and in the process scoring his first half-century in T20 cricket. The Mumbai-lad comfortably outscored his skipper in the partnership, contributing 47 runs as against Duminy&rsquo;s 26 runs. He was particularly severe on the leg-spinner Karn Sharma, hitting him for three sixes and scoring 21 runs off eight deliveries. <br /><br /> The opening batsman was dismissed in the twelfth over when he was deceived by a slower delivery from Praveen Kumar and miscued an attempted slog to be caught at cover; Iyer made 60 from 40 balls and left the park with the score reading 93 for 2. <br /><br /> Duminy, who was initially scoring at a run-a-ball, switched gears after Iyer was dismissed; he hit Ravi Bopara for a boundary in the 13th over and then punished the medium-pacer further in his next over, hitting two fours and a six. In the 16th over, Duminy hit Dale Steyn for a six over long on, but the fast bowler had the last laugh, disturbing the woodwork behind the batsman. Duminy made 54 from 41 balls, aided with five boundaries and two sixes. <br /><br /> DD suffered a big blow immediately after as Yuvraj Singh&rsquo;s innings was curtailed by a fantastic catch by David Warner; the left-hander&rsquo;s pull appeared to have enough height and distance, but Warner, fielding at midwicket, timed his jump well, caught the ball and landed just inside the rope. <br /><br /> Angelo Mathews (19 from 12 balls) and Kedar Jadhav (15 from 11) found the boundary thrice in the last two overs to help DD finish their twenty overs at 167 for 4. <br /><br /> For SRH, Steyn and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were the pick of the bowlers; their eight overs together cost the team 48 runs and yielded two wickets. Praveen Kumar and Ashish Reddy were the other wicket-takers. <br /><br /> Cut to the run-chase, DD kept their nerves despite their opponents getting off to a solid start. Warner and Shikhar Dhawan helped their team to 20 in the first four overs before the latter exploded in the fifth over, hitting Angelo Mathews for three boundaries. Warner picked on Domnic Joseph and hit him for four boundaries in the following over. The partnership was broken just after the Powerplay overs when Duminy got the ball to straighten and sneak in between the bad and pad to castle Dhawan. Two balls later, Warner was beaten in flight and drove straight back, and Duminy lunged forward and came up with the ball in hand. From 50 for no loss, SRH had quickly slipped to 51 for two. <br /><br /> KL Rahul struck two humongous sixes off Yuvraj Singh and Amit Mishra, and added 38 runs in the company of Ravi Bopara, before he lost his leg stump to Angelo Mathews. He made 24 from 21 balls and left the arena with his team needing 79 runs from 46 balls. <br /><br /> Ravi Bopara hit a couple of lusty blows before he holed out to Manoj Tiwary. Karn Sharma took the chase closer, hitting two sixes off Imran Tahir, and Ashish Reddy hit a four and a six in the 19th over to leave SRH needing 10 from the final over. Nathan Coulter-Nile bowled a fantastic final over, conceding only five runs, and Mayank Agarwal pulled off a fantastic save off the penultimate delivery to leave SRH four runs short. <br /><br /> Duminy and Coulter-Nile were the pick of the DD bowlers, accounting for five wickets and conceding only 43 runs in seven overs.</p>"},"tags":[],"timestamp":1429367093000,"id":1164956,"time":"14:02","updateTime":1429365752168,"sequence":388.0,"type":"Manual"},{"bbcode":"[b]Warner:[/b] \"It's obviously disappointing we didn't get across the line but we didn't start well with the new ball and we are losing too many wickets simultaneously.
