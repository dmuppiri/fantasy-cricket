Their total of 201 for 4 proved to be enough against Rajasthan Royals, who despite a cameo from Chris Morris fell short by seven runs at the Brabourne Stadium. \\n\\n The chase needed a solid start from the openers but the Royals found themselves rattled by the quick dismissals of Ajinkya Rahane and Shane Watson. \\n\\n After two crunching drives in the opening over, Rahane edged Bhuvneshwar Kumar to the wicketkeeper and Watson (12) perished after he failed to clear mid-on off Ishant Sharma. \\n\\n Steven Smith, meanwhile, benefitted from some shoddy fielding from the Sunrisers after walking in at No 3.

Trying to back away towards leg to slog, a fast delivery from Tambe cramped Henriques for room, leaving to him getting bowled in the 11th over. \\n\\n But the wickets didn't worry Dhawan as he and Morgan kept on scoring freely, hitting the ball to all parts of the ground. Dhawan unleashed some fearsome shots off his willow en route his innings. But while trying to accelerate in the 15th over, Dhawan missed and bowler James Faulker rattled his stumps. \\n\\n Morgan, who reached 50 in 23 balls, went for a six but found Steve Smith at long-off off Watson. But the damage was already done. Ravi Bopara (17 not out) and Naman Ojha (8 not out) remained unbeaten for Sunrisers.","subtype":"BBCode","message":{"text":"<p><strong>Match Report:&nbsp;</strong> A late cameo by Eoin Morgan and a steady knock by opener Shikhar Dhawan helped Sunrisers Hyderabad to their best batting performance in Pepsi IPL 2015. Their total of 201 for 4 proved to be enough against Rajasthan Royals, who despite a cameo from Chris Morris fell short by seven runs at the Brabourne Stadium. <br /><br /> The chase needed a solid start from the openers but the Royals found themselves rattled by the quick dismissals of Ajinkya Rahane and Shane Watson. <br /><br /> After two crunching drives in the opening over, Rahane edged Bhuvneshwar Kumar to the wicketkeeper and Watson (12) perished after he failed to clear mid-on off Ishant Sharma. <br /><br /> Steven Smith, meanwhile, benefitted from some shoddy fielding from the Sunrisers after walking in at No 3. A mix-up between Warner and Karn Sharma meant the ball landed safely between them when the batsman was on 0, and then was put down by Moises Henriques at deep square leg when he was on 14. <br /><br /> Smith smashed a fifty off 32 balls and boundaries continued to come until he was bowled up by Bopara in the 15th over for 68. <br /><br /> James Faulkner (30, 19b, 2x4, 2x6), Sanju Samson (21, 10b, 3x6) and Morris (34*, 11b, 2x4, 3x6), however, nearly pulled off a miracle. Faulkner and Samson's brisk innings had meant the Royals hadn't thrown in the towel, but Morris's assault nearly took them over the line. <br /><br /> Needing 40 from the last two overs, Morris belted 21 from the 19th over off Praveen but Bhuvneshwar's final over saved Sunrisers Hyderabad the blushes as Rajasthan Royals ended on 197 for 7. <br /><br /> Earlier, Sunrisers got off to a cracking start with openers David Warner and Dhawan scoring at over 10 runs an over but all-rounder Watson worked wonders for the home side in the fifth over. <br /><br /> After captain Warner (24; 18b, 5x4) struck Watson for two boundaries on first two balls, he tried to make it three in a row but failed as an edge carried comfortably to wicketkeeper Sanju Samson with the Sunrisers at 48. <br /><br /> Moises Henriques struck 20 off 21 balls, striking three boundaries but soon perished in the 10th over, off 43-year-old spinner Pravim Tambe. Trying to back away towards leg to slog, a fast delivery from Tambe cramped Henriques for room, leaving to him getting bowled in the 11th over. <br /><br /> But the wickets didn't worry Dhawan as he and Morgan kept on scoring freely, hitting the ball to all parts of the ground. Dhawan unleashed some fearsome shots off his willow en route his innings. But while trying to accelerate in the 15th over, Dhawan missed and bowler James Faulker rattled his stumps. <br /><br /> Morgan, who reached 50 in 23 balls, went for a six but found Steve Smith at long-off off Watson. But the damage was already done. Ravi Bopara (17 not out) and Naman Ojha (8 not out) remained unbeaten for Sunrisers.</p>"},"tags":[],"timestamp":1431011211000,"id":1189012,"time":"14:01","updateTime":1431007297552,"sequence":384.5,"type":"Manual"},{"bbcode":"[b]Watson: [/b]\"They got a few too many runs in the back end of their innings, but we had a great crack at it.
