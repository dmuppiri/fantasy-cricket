After setting the visitors a stiff target of 188, the hosts were in a spot of bother when young Sanju Samson put RR on course with a scintillating innings of 76. However, after he was dismissed with RR needing 27 runs from 14 balls, the visitors lost the plot and finished nine runs short. \\n\\n RR were on course for major part of their run-chase. The opening pair of Ajinkya Rahane and Shane Watson got them off to a brisk start adding 30 runs in three overs. Following Rahane s dismissal, Watson added 41 runs in five overs in the company of Samson, with both batsmen making almost even contributions. \\n\\n It was in the nine-overs period of play   after Watson was dismissed in the ninth over for a brisk 28   that RR tightened their grip on the chase. The 20-year old Sanju mixed audaciousness and cheekiness as he took on the best in the Mumbai Indians lineup and brought up his career-best score in T20 cricket; against Harbhajan Singh he used the late cut to good effect apart from playing the ball with the spin, and against Lasith Malinga, he played some stunning shots   including a pull shot that sent the ball sailing over midwicket and a cheeky scoop that sent the ball over the head of the short fine-leg fielder. \\n\\n The partnership between Sanju and Steve Smith was worth 56 runs. After struggling to put bat to ball on a handful of occasions in the 15th over, Smith attempted to take the aggressive way out and threw his bat at a wide delivery to be caught on the thirdman boundary; he made 23 from 20 balls. \\n\\n Sanju perished in the eighteenth over when he found the man at long off; he made 76, and hit seven fours and three sixes in his 46-ball stay at the wicket. RR lost two more wickets shortly after for the addition of one run, and that meant the wheels had come off the chase. RR finished their chase at 179 for 7. \\n\\n For MI, Mitchell McClenaghan was the most successful bowler; the left-armer dismissed the two well-set batsmen   Smith and Samson, and followed it up with the wicket of Karun Nair. Malinga, Vinay Kumar and Suchith picked up a wicket each. \\n\\n The Mumbai Indians, put in to bat, got the start they wanted, courtesy Lendl Simmons and Parthiv Patel. The left-hander was the more aggressive of the two openers; Parthiv scored five of the first six boundaries in the innings, which included some fluent cuts and drives through the off-side and taking full toll of leg-stump deliveries. Just when it appeared that MI would realise their first half-century opening partnership of the season, Parthiv was dismissed against the run of play; the left-hander drove a full length delivery straight down the ground, but the bowler Dhawal Kulkarni thrust his hands out and latched on to the ball. The opening partnership was nipped at 43 runs in 4.5 overs. \\n\\n Simmons hit four boundaries and a six before he was adjudged LBW, when it appeared the ball might have kissed his bat during his attempt to paddle the left-arm spinner Ankit Sharma; he made 38 from 31 balls. Rohit Sharma played a couple of delightful strokes before his innings was culled by a smart one-handed catch by Ankit Sharma at short fine-leg. The score read 120 for 4 after 14.5 overs when the MI skipper was dismissed for 27 (21 balls). \\n\\n Come the final quarter of the innings, Ambati Rayudu turned on the heat; the 29-year old, who had had a lean tournament until then, dominated proceedings despite the presence of the big-hitting Kieron Pollard. Rayudu had 17 from 13 balls when four overs remained to be bowled in the innings, but thereafter scored 36 runs from the next fourteen balls. He hit Rusty Theron for a six in the 17th, picked up a boundary off the first delivery of the 18th (bowled by Shane Watson), and got stuck into Tim Southee in the 19th hitting him for two fours and a six. He signed off in style, picking up a boundary off the last ball of the innings. Rayudu remained unbeaten on 53 from 27 balls. Pollard played second-fiddle in the 61-run stand with Rayudu contributing 24 from 14 balls. \\n\\n Mumbai Indians added 61 runs in the final overs, eventually finishing their twenty overs at 187 for 5. Local lad Kulkarni was the most successful wicket-taker for the visitors, picking up two wickets in his three-over spell, while Southee, Theron and Ankit returned with a wicket apiece.","subtype":"BBCode","message":{"text":"<p><strong>Match Report:</strong> The Mumbai Indians took their tally of wins in Pepsi IPL 2015 to three after they defeated the Rajasthan Royals by eight runs in a thrilling match at the Wankhede Stadium.
