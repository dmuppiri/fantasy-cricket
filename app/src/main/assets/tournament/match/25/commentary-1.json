They were back to winning ways in the following two matches, before losing their most-recent match   a rain-affected encounter against Sunrisers Hyderabad. The team, led by Gautam Gambhir, will be concerned by their most-recent performance when they failed to separate the SRH opening pair and allowed them to amass 130 runs on the board.
