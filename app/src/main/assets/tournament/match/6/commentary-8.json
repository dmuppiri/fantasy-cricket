And the Delhi Daredevils certainly don t seem to have imbibe that habit. Despite posting a challenging 184 runs on the board, they couldn t prevent their opponents Rajasthan Royals from scoring the one run more that gave them two points from the match. By virtue of their 3-wicket victory, the Rajasthan Royals climbed to second in the standings and stretched DD s losing streak to 11 matches. Ajinkya Rahane held his end firm for most part of the innings even as batsmen at the other end walked in, chipped in a few runs and perished. Sanju Samson made 11, captain Steve Smith made 10 and Karun Nair made a breezy 20. \\n\\n Reduced to 78 for 4 in the 11th over, RR needed 107 from 56 balls, at which point Rahane and Deepak Hooda turned on the heat. Hooda in particular was ruthless; he hit Angelo Mathews for a six and two fours in the 13th over, deposited Unadkat into the stands twice in the 15th over and Imran Tahir into the stands at long on in the 16th over. Rahane and Hooda added 52 runs in 4.3 overs to put their team in the driver s seat. Rahane creamed three crisp sixes and two boundaries in his 39-ball outing before he perished at the start of the 16th over. \\n\\n The teenager carried on and brought up his half-century off 22 balls   aided with three boundaries and four hits over the fence. He was dismissed off the first ball of the 19th over when he pulled a long hop but hit it straight down the throat of Mathews at long on. That dismissal triggered a bit of panic in the RR lower order, but Chris Morris struck a four and a six, and Tim Southee drove Angelo Mathews through extra cover for a boundary to take their team past the finish line. \\n\\n Imran Tahir impressed yet again; he used the leg-breaks and googlies deceptively, presented few scoring opportunities to the RR batsmen and returned with figures of four for 28. Amit Mishra (2-32) and Mathews (1-42) were the other wicket-takers. \\n\\n Earlier in the evening, put in to bat, the Delhi Daredevils gave their supporters plenty to cheer as their openers Mayank Agarwal and Shreyas Iyer wasted little time in their team off to a brisk start. Agarwal especially was the more aggressive of the two batsmen; the Karnataka lad set the ball rolling with a pull shot off Tim Southee in the first over and then creamed one over the cover boundary in the same bowler s next over. \\n\\n Dhawal Kulkarni was welcomed into the attack with three consecutive boundaries by Agarwal and piled on the agony further picking up a boundary off the final delivery of the over. The opening pair was separated in the fifth over   after they had put on 45 runs - when Agarwal danced down the track and attempted to hit over the top but was foxed in length by the experienced Pravin Tambe and hit straight back to the bowler; Agarwal made 37 from 21 balls and hit six boundaries and a six during his vigil at the crease. \\n\\n JP Duminy promoted himself to number three and batted through to the end of the innings. It was an indifferent innings from the DD captain; up until the final over of the innings   when he struck two sixes   his strike-rate was 88.24. He made 44 from 38 balls and was involved in useful partnerships with Yuvraj Singh (27 batting at number four) and Angelo Mathews (unbeaten 27 batting at number five). This was the first time in DD s history that they had four partnerships of 40 or more in an IPL innings. As a result, DD finished their 20 overs at a competitive 184 for 3   their first score of 180 or more batting first since 27 April 2012. \\n\\n Chris Morris was the most successful of the RR bowlers; the South African returned with figures of 2 for 35. The experienced Tambe, who was surprisingly used only for three overs, had respectable returns of 1 for 18. Deepak Hooda was impressive too; the 19-year old did not concede a single boundary and bowled his four overs for 20 overs. RR s two experienced bowlers   Tim Southee and James Faulkner   had an off-day at work; while Southee s four overs cost the team 36 runs, Faulkner   who single-handedly won the team the previous match - registered his most expensive figures in T20 cricket, conceding 55 runs in his four over spell.","subtype":"BBCode","message":{"text":"<p><strong>Match Report:</strong> They say &ldquo;winning is a habit&rdquo;.
