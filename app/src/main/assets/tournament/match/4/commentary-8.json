McCullum and his opening partner Dwayne Smith helped their team to 49 runs before the fielding restrictions were relaxed. The pair stretched their association further to 75 runs when a direct hit from Trent Boult brought about Smith s dismissal. Suresh Raina, who batted at number three, made 14 before he too was run out   courtesy a direct hit by KL Rahul. \\n\\n McCullum was ruthless on the Sunrisers Hyderabad bowlers until the 14th over from which point onwards MS Dhoni stole the limelight.

He was particularly severe on Ishant Sharma, who he hit for 30 runs off 12 balls. \\n\\n Dhoni promoted himself to number four, and despite the presence of a well-set batsman at the crease, stamped his authority on the proceedings.

He needed to score 11 off the final three deliveries to get to his sixth T20 century, and he did just enough   in some style too. He danced around the crease, forced the bowler to bowl a full toss, and lifted the ball straight over his shoulder and the wicket-keeper s head for a six. The following delivery he picked up a boundary through thirdman and signed off the innings with a quick single that would give take him to the hundred. \\n\\n While McCullum and Dhoni were the star performers, the story for CSK was also about partnerships. After the openers had added 70, the second wicket pair added 60 and the third wicket pair added 63 runs. CSK finished their allotted 20 overs at 209 for 4. \\n\\n Ravi Bopara, who was a surprise selection in the SRH XI, was the pick of the bowlers, conceding only 29 runs in his four overs. Trent Boult was the lone wicket-taker, while Ishant and Karn Sharma came in for plenty of stick conceding 97 runs in their seven overs combined. Ishant, returning to competitive cricket after more than three months, didn t help his cause as he bowled four No Balls and ended up conceding 46 runs in his three overs. \\n\\n SRH s run-chase got off to a brisk start   with David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan adding 30 in quick time, but they never really got their teeth. There were few loose deliveries to punish and Dhoni changed his bowlers around intelligently to strangle the SRH batsmen. Warner batted until the 15th over, but that he only faced 42 deliveries explains he didn t get too much of strike, despite being the team s premier batsman. The SRH skipper made 53 and hit just one boundary and three sixes in his knock. SRH finished their 20 overs with 164 runs on the board. \\n\\n For CSK, R Ashwin (1-22) was the most impressive of the bowlers; he bowled good lines and lengths, used the angles smartly and bowled his pace that didn t make stroke-making easy.
